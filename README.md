In 2018, most of the translation software on the application market will add many unnecessary functions, resulting in slow startup speed, frequent use requirements and low-end machine users difficult to obtain a good experience. In addition, a translation software often only supports its corresponding translation software. Translate data.

- From the perspective of providing convenience, I designed a lightweight translation software that integrates the translation results of websites such as Baidu, Youdao, Jinshan, Bing, etc. (using jsoup). Users can get the most accurate interpretation through comparison.
  
- Implemented the word book (using litePal) to easily store, add, delete, and modify the words consulted.
  
- Implemented the word-marking translation function. When browsing the text, copying a piece of text can directly pop up the translation result, without having to go back to the software to query.
  
- The software size is only 2MB, runs fast, and has good compatibility.
